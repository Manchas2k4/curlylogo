Safari Issues:

#2 FIXED (on WebKit). Turtle is bug-eyed.  Using a "use" in a clip-path is a known WebKit
bug. http://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15514

#3 FIXED (phew!). Turtle doesn't move.  No idea, but it presumably objects
to my setting of value properties directly.  FD 50 SETPC "RED FD 50 draws 2
dots (one black, one red) so new path elements are being created.  It's
just that they have d attributes like: "M400,150L400,150" which is no
good at all.  Problem is that the code in turtle.forward has a call to
setMatrix.  This call does not change the transform in any way! (bug
http://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16075 now fixed in WebKit)
David Dailey suggests,
http://srufaculty.sru.edu/david.dailey/svg/drag.svg , just setting the
text of the transform attribute.  *sigh* (the same hacky way that the
path drawing works).  This works.  We have an "in".
Oh the horror.  a.multiply(b) is supposed to post multiply a by b (as
per the spec).  And it does in Safari.  But Firefox, which I got working
first, _pre_-multiples a by b. Oh. My. God.

#5 FIXED? Divide operator doesn't work.  Hmm, something to do with
tokenisation. (Alt-p * Alt-p doesn't work either).  Seems to work on
Safari 3.0.4

#1 FIXED. No display.  This turned out to be because it was computing the width
of div#vp as 0 pixels.  Fixed by width: 97%.  Web Inspector was very
useful.

#4 FIXED. Output area never has a newline.  No idea.  XHTML verus HTML
paragraph thing?  Yes.  Web Inspector both helps and hinders here.
XHTML elements SHOULD be created using createElementNS otherwise Safari
won't recognise them (correct, but sheer bloody minded).  A Web
Inspector bug means that the Namespace displayed for elements without a
namespace is whatever you last clicked on that did have a namespace.

#6 FIXED. Tooltips doesn't work (no tips at all). Like #4 turned out
that making the SPAN elements correctly in the XHTML namespace fixed
this.
