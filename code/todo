:todo:iphone: Support iPod / iPhone by using Apple's canvas element
  instead of SVG.

:todo:15word: Execute all or most of the 15 word contest entries (or at
  least the winners): http://www.mathcats.com/gallery/15wordcontest.html

:todo:colors: list of colors in the help.

:todo:lt: <, <=, etc.

:todo:variadic-equal: = and != for multiple arguments.

:todo:history: arrow-key history.

:todo:save: SAVE. (done for cookies)

:todo:stop: STOP.

:todo:repl-scroll: Make REPL area scrollable / clipped so that
  prolonged use (that is, more than a few commands) does not result
  in having to scroll between the turtle area and the command prompt.
  In Firefox at least this can be done by incrementing the div's scrollTop
  property (by 300 say) each time there is output (method due to Robin
  Johnson).  This certainly seems to work but is mysterious and ugly (see
  http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms535255.aspx).  Done, but boy
  is it ugly.  Also it doesn't work if there is more than 300 pixels of
  scrolling to do.

:todo:upper-case: Handle upper and lower case.  I propose: symbols
  (strings) retain their case on reading, but when they are used as
  variables all variable names are lower-cased.  Thus case-insensitive but
  case-preserving.  Like the HFS+ file system.

:todo:prompt: Change prompt when gathering procedure for TO mode.

:todo:output: Implement OUTPUT.

:todo:paren-infix: parentheses for infix syntax.

:todo:list: basic list package. (MEMBER? implemented)

:todo:print: PRINT and SHOW.

:todo:doc-other: provide tooltip documentation for things like the arrow
  that is used to represent execution, NaN, "to", numbers, and other
  things that appear in the output window but which are not Logo objects.

:todo:svg-bug: submit SVG bug to Firefox:

      <path id='p1' transform='translate(15, 20) scale(1.3)'
        d='M 0 0 c 15 -7 20 -7 35 0 s 20 7 40 0' stroke='blue'
        fill='none' />
      <text stroke='none' fill='#ddd' font-size='20'><textPath
        method='stretch'
        xlink:href='#p1'>Curly Logo</textPath></text>

  This clips the 'l' in 'Curly' out completely.  I have no idea if this
  is allowed, but even if it is allowed, it's not desirable.


Done

:done:repeat: REPEAT.

:done:repl-tidy: Tidy the REPL output. (now done, at least on Firefox /
Mac, at for the first round).

:done:st-ht: ST and HT (show and hide turtle)

:done:to: TO special form. (local variables / arguments don't work)

:done:math: basic math package.

:done:floating-point-input: Floating point input.

:done:paren: Lisp syntax.

:done:idontknow: "I don't know how to X" error message.

:done:if: Implement IF.

:done:bad-float: reject "1e" and friends.  They are now accepted as
  symbols.

:done:infix: infix operators. (now done, but parentheses don't
  work see :todo:paren-infix)

:done:focus: Focus to type in area when page is loaded.

:todo:double: SVG (on OS X) uses float precision for matrix
  multiplication.  Meh.  Do it in JavaScript in doubles.

:todo:gallery: Gallery.  See :idea:url-scrape which might make this
  easier.

:todo:opera: Support Opera.

:todo:wii: Support Wii (uses opera, see :support:opera )

:todo:heading-bug: rt 400 should not make turtle.getH() return 400.
