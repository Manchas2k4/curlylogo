bash seems to implement something like a shadow editable item for each
history item.  When a new item is typed and added (by pressing Return)
it is appended to the end of history.  If up arrow is used to go to a
previous history item at that is executed, it is copied as a new item
and appended to the end of the history.  If a previous item is edited
then the edited version remains in place in the history (until Return is
pressed); there can be several edited historical items at once.  When
Return is pressed on an edited item the edited contents get copied as a
new item and appended, but the original item at that place in the
history gets restored.

This is actually pretty intuitive.  But a right pain to get at the
original contents of a line once edited without executing the edited
version!
