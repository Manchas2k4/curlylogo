On Saving

By saving I mean creating a persistent copy of created procedures etc.

Should be able to save:

- Without a net connexion or a storage device.
- Onto a shared web server.
- Onto a USB pen or similar.

Stupid idea: Save Logo procedures as a PNG image on Flickr / Picasa /
  whatever.  Observation: PNG supports multiple segments including text
  segments, so we can simply create a text segment and add the Logo
  program as text (this is the same ideas as things like EXIF or Math
  PNG: http://www.mathtran.org/wiki/index.php/Math_PNG ).  The obvious
  image is to use is an example of the Logo procedure's graphical
  output.  Many variations on this theme.

www.box.net / Amazon S3.  There must be loads of these.
