Logo's Syntax

I actually quite like Logo's syntax, but it's a bit hard to pin down.

Lexis

[]()
symbols:
/[\w.]+/
or something like that

lisp reader style macrology:
"foo is (quote foo)
:foo is (thing (quote foo))

UCB-Logo says (http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bh/usermanual):

Within square brackets, words are delimited only by spaces and square
brackets.  [2+3] is a list containing one word.

After a quotation mark outside square brackets, a word is delimited by
a space, a square bracket, or a parenthesis.

but the parsing seems really ad-hoc and complicated.

It is, see the Core Spec.


Wishlist

It would be nice if FD X+2*Y worked.  Humans have no problem parsing
this.  An idea from ML appeals to me: that there should be "punctuation
symbols" and "word symbols".  Common Lisp suggests that it's nice when
word-symbols can contain a hyphen (like CALL-WITH-CURRENT-CONTINUATION).
This gets very hairy.  Simplest thing would be to make '-' part of a
word-symbol and therefore require that it be surrounded with spaces when
it is used in an expression (for minus).
