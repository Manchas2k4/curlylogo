Adapting the Homerton LOGO Manual to Curly Logo

[Complete up to end of chapter 3]

1.1 To begin Curly Logo you need to open the Firefox web browser and
give it the appropriate URL.

1.3 Typing errors are corrected using Backspace and the usual editing
keys.

2.6 Wraparound.  Curly Logo does not implement FENCE, WINDOW, and WRAP.
It is effectively always in WINDOW mode (the turtle can go anywhere on
an infinite plane, but the viewport is finite).

3.2 When entering a procedure using TO the prompt does not change to '>'
(but perhaps it should).

3.3 Curly Logo is very unlikely to pause noticeably whilst storing the
procedure.

3.4 (but really thoughout) in HLM commands are presented using uppercase
letters.  Not only is this unnecessary and unconventional in Curly Logo,
it current won't work (but is intended to).

3.5 SAVE and LOAD and not currently supported.

3.6 Tape is not supported (and never will be).
