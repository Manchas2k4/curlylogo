<p>Introducing Curly Logo</p>

<p>Does your Logo run on Macs, Linux, and even PCs with Windows?</p>

<p>Does your Logo produce beautiful anti-aliased artwork?</p>

<p>Does your Logo let you change the width of the pen?</p>

<p>Is your Logo free?</p>

<p>In all the approved senses of the word?</p>

<p>Does your Logo require Absolutely No Installation?</p>

<p>Can you use your Logo from a public terminal?</p>

<p>Does your Logo let you use the elementary division, &#247;, and
multiplication, &#215;, signs in arithmetic expressions (like this: "100
&#215 &#960 &#247 n")?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amberfrog.com/logo/">Curly Logo</a> does and
is all of these things.  Why aren't you using it?</p>
